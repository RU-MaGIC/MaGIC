## Standard Service Offerings
The Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core offers a variety of standard services. Each of these standard services has a defined start and end point. As certain custom requests are developed they may be offered as standard services. 

### Whole Genome Sequencing Analysis Services
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_wgs" %}

### RNA Sequencing Analysis Services

{% include feature_row id="feature_row_rna" %}

### Epigenetics Sequencing Analysis Services

{% include feature_row id="feature_row_epi" %}

### Amplicon Sequencing Services

{% include feature_row id="feature_row_amp" %}

## Custom Service Offerings

MaGIC can additionally offer custom services on a case-by-case basis. This entails going beyond the standard offerings and will be proactively discussed with investigators to determine timeline and budget for each project. Some examples are:

- Additional custom plotting beyond standard offering
- Personal pipeline development
- Web page development
- Protein analysis services
