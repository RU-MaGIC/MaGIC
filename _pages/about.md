# Bioinformatics at Rutgers NJMS- MaGIC
The Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core is designed to provide bioinformatics research services to members of the [Rutgers NJMS](http://njms.rutgers.edu/) community, as well as the [Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/) community as a whole and industry collaborators. 

## Mission
The mission of the Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core is to support cutting edge researchers by providing expertise in high-throughput computational analyses. This is to be provided by utilizing up-to-date pipelines for expediting standard workflows, and implementing custom bioinformatics analyses to accomodate the myriad of solutions for academic research. MaGIC will also emphasizes training opportunities by providing remote bioinformatics learning tools, project support and assistance on request, and regular courses.

## History of Bioinformatics at Rutgers NJMS
The Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core (MaGIC) was initiated at the end of 2019 to build into a full-service bioinformatics core facility at [Rutgers RBHS Newark (NJMS)](http://njms.rutgers.edu/). This was begun with just one scientist, a workstation, and a few nodes on the [Amarel HPC](https://oarc.rutgers.edu/amarel/). The inception of MaGIC was performed with tight collaboration with [The Genomics Center](http://research.njms.rutgers.edu/genomics/) and the [Office of Advanced Research Computing](https://oarc.rutgers.edu/).
